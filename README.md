This week I learned how to create my repository on github. And how to change that repository by putty. The most important part is to update that file which is in that repository to github by putty. In the end, I unecpected learned how to copy things form one file to other file which is in the other folder.

This week we learned how to creat a file and create a folder on Puttty. And we learned how to remove them by different command as well. The most interesting part is to "pico" some file and change it by ourself. The password on our putty was complex, so we lreaned how change our password as well.
