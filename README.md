This is my last reflection, I learned a lot in this class during this half of year. This makes me know that programming is very interesting process. I started to thinking what code they might made when I was playing a game, or using some program online. These program may not be created by python, but these experience makes me enjoy using my computer. This half of year it's my enlightenment in program and I really used my own code to creat a game, it feels better than be a MVP in any game I played.

This week learned how to create a progarm to simulate two people throw dice. During this work, I learned how to creat a function to dis a random integer in a range. And to create a function to compare the differences results to make different response. Also figured out a function that puzzled me for a long time. This function just like a scoreboard, it can increase or decrease a fraction(Actually is numbers) and to get different result.

This week I learn how to make a program that can makes different responds based on the range of numbers. And how to use right command to let user's answer to change the word case. I still learned how to change users' answer's color. Finally, I learned to create a program which is kind of like a guess game, it can be really crazy if user made bad decision.
